# Inheritance is when an object or class is based on another object  or class, using the same implementation  or specifying a new implementation to maintain the same behavior.
Such an inherited class is called a subclass of its parent class or super class.
Types of inheritance: 
1.Single inheritance where subclasses inherit the features of one superclass. A class acquires the properties of another class.
2.Multiple inheritance where one class can have more than one superclass and inherit features from all parent classes.
